When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can’t change that value.

Rust nudges you to write code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency.

That means that when you’re reading and writing code, you don’t have to keep track of how and where a value might change. Your code is thus easier to reason through.
